													  National Fertilizer Corporation of Pakistan  is  one  of  the  largest  employers of qualified engineers particularly in the field of Chemical  Engineering.  In  order  to meet the requirement of trained manpower for chemical process industry especially in the fertilizer sector, a Training Center was established in 1985 with the technical assistance of M/s. COSMO International Co., Ltd., Japan.  The  Center   trained   managers, engineers, supervisors,  operators/  technicians  through  multi-dimensional programs that vary widely in content and duration for all types of process and engineering industry.

To further diversify the activities of the Centre and in line with the education policy announced by the Government of Pakistan,  NFC  with  the  approval  of  Ministry  of Industries & Production, Government of Pakistan upgraded the Centre in 1994  and started graduate engineering classes initially in Chemical Engineering discipline and changed its nomenclature as “NFC  Institute  of  Engineering  & Technological training”. This was also the need of the country and particularly of this area.
